 &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;Cygnus Releases from International Space Station&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/content/cygnus-releases-from-international-space-station&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;Expedition 37 crew members aboard the International Space Station released Orbital Sciences&amp;#039; Cygnus spacecraft from the station&amp;#039;s robotic arm at 7:31 a.m. EDT on Oct. 22. Orbital Sciences engineers now will conduct a series of planned burns and maneuvers to move Cygnus toward a destructive re-entry in Earth&amp;#039;s atmosphere Wednesday, Oct. 23.
Cygnus had been attached to the space station&amp;#039;s Harmony module for 23 days. The spacecraft delivered about 1,300 pounds (589 kilograms) of cargo, including food, clothing and student experiments, on a demonstration cargo resupply mission to the station.
Cygnus was launched on Orbital&amp;#039;s Antares rocket on Sept. 18 from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Pad-0A at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia.

 &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;Earth from Juno&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/content/earth-from-juno&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;On Oct. 9, Juno flew by Earth using the home planet&amp;#039;s gravity to get a boost needed to reach Jupiter. The JunoCam caught this image of Earth, and other instruments were tested to ensure they work as designed during a close planetary encounter. 
The Juno spacecraft was launched from NASA&amp;#039;s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Aug. 5, 2011. Juno’s rocket, the Atlas 551, was only capable of giving Juno enough energy or speed to reach the asteroid belt, at which point the Sun’s gravity pulled Juno back toward the inner solar system. The Earth flyby gravity assist increases the spacecraft’s speed to put it on course for arrival at Jupiter on July 4, 2016.

 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/multimedia/saturn20131017.html&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;This portrait looking down on Saturn and its rings was created from images obtained by NASA&amp;#039;s Cassini spacecraft on Oct. 10, 2013. It was made by amateur image processor and Cassini fan Gordan Ugarkovic.&nbsp;This image has not been geometrically corrected for shifts in the spacecraft perspective and still has some camera artifacts.The mosaic was created from 12 image footprints with red, blue and green filters from Cassini&amp;#039;s imaging science subsystem. Ugarkovic used full color sets for 11 of the footprints and red and blue images for one footprint.
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA&amp;#039;s Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.

 &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;Northern Lights Viewed From the International Space Station&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/content/northern-lights-viewed-from-the-international-space-station&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;Astronaut Mike Hopkins, aboard the International Space Station, shared this picture of the northern lights on Oct. 9, 2013, saying &amp;quot;The pic doesn&amp;#039;t do the northern lights justice. Covered the whole sky. Truly amazing!&amp;quot; The northern lights are caused by collisions between fast-moving particles (electrons) from space and the oxygen and nitrogen gas in our atmosphere. These electrons originate in the magnetosphere, the region of space controlled by Earth’s magnetic field. As they rain into the atmosphere, the electrons impart energy to oxygen and nitrogen molecules, making them excited. When the molecules return to their normal state, they release photons, small bursts of energy in the form of light.
Astronauts have used hand-held cameras to photograph the Earth for more than 40 years. Beginning with the Mercury missions in the early 1960s, astronauts have taken more than 700,000 photographs of the Earth. Today, the space station continues the NASA tradition of Earth observation from human-tended spacecraft.

 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/dawn/multimedia/pia15678.html&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;As NASA&amp;#039;s Dawn spacecraft travels to its next destination, this mosaic synthesizes some of the best views the spacecraft had of the giant asteroid Vesta. Dawn studied Vesta from July 2011 to September 2012. The towering mountain at the south pole - more than twice the height of Mount Everest - is visible at the bottom of the image. The set of three craters known as the &amp;quot;snowman&amp;quot; can be seen at the top left.
	
	These images are the last in Dawn&amp;#039;s Image of the Day series during the cruise to Dawn&amp;#039;s second destination, Ceres. A full set of Dawn data is being archived at http://pds.nasa.gov/ .
	
	The Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres is managed by NASA&amp;#039;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, for NASA&amp;#039;s Science Mission Directorate, Washington D.C. UCLA is responsible for overall Dawn mission science. The Dawn framing cameras were developed and built under the leadership of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany, with significant contributions by DLR German Aerospace Center, Institute of Planetary Research, Berlin, and in coordination with the Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Braunschweig. The Framing Camera project is funded by the Max Planck Society, DLR, and NASA/JPL.

 &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;Glow with the Flow&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/aero/flow_patterns_image.html&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;Researchers at NASA&amp;#039;s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., use all sorts of tools and techniques to learn more during the development of aircraft and spacecraft designs.
In this photo, engineers led by researcher Greg Gatlin have sprayed fluorescent oil on a 5.8 percent scale model of a futuristic hybrid wing body during tests in the14 by-22-Foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel.
The oil helps researchers &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the flow patterns when air passes over and around the model. Those patterns are important in determining crucial aircraft characteristics such as lift and drag.

 &lt;item&gt; &lt;title&gt;Two Generations of Windblown Sediments on Mars&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/content/two-generations-of-windblown-sediments-on-mars&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;This colorful scene is situated in the Noctis Labyrinthus region of Mars, perched high on the Tharsis rise in the upper reaches of the Valles Marineris canyon system.
Targeting the bright rimmed bedrock knobs, the image also captures the interaction of two distinct types of windblown sediments. Surrounding the bedrock knobs is a network of pale reddish ridges with a complex interlinked morphology. These pale ridges resemble the simpler “transverse aeolian ridges” (called TARs) that are common in the equatorial regions of Mars.
The TARs are still poorly understood, and are variously ascribed to dunes produced by reversing winds, coarse grained ripples, or indurated dust deposits. HiRISE observations of TARs have so far shown that these bedforms are stable over time, suggesting either that they form slowly over much longer time scales than the duration of MRO&amp;#039;s mission, or that they formed in the past during periods of very different atmospheric conditions than the present.
Dark sand dunes comprise the second type of windblown sediment visible in this image. The dark sand dune seen just below the center of the cutout displays features that are common to active sand dunes observed by HiRISE elsewhere on Mars, including sets of small ripples crisscrossing the top of the dune. In many cases, it is the motion of these smaller ripples that drives the advance of Martian sand dunes. The dark dunes are made up of grains composed of iron-rich minerals derived from volcanic rocks on Mars, unlike the pale quartz-rich dunes typical of Earth.
This image clearly shows the dark sand situated on top of the pale TAR network, indicating that the sand dunes are younger than the TARs. Moreover, the fresh appearance of the sand dunes suggest that they are currently active, and may help shape the unusual TAR morphology by sandblasting the TARs in the present day environment.
The original image was acquired on Aug. 31, 2013, by the HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) instrument aboard NASA&amp;#039;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). HiRISE is operated by the University of Arizona, Tucson.
